# PCB schematics and layouts

## Linear actuator

First version of the fully integrated linear actuator.

### Errata

- a few analog pins are not connected to analog inputs...
- encoder is not lined up with quadrature tracks (quadrature phase is not 90 degrees)

## Linear actuator 2

Second version, manufactured with 2 oz of copper.

### Errata

- there is a mistake with the motor windings, with the windings being abcABC instead of aBcAbC
- BOM forgot a part (diode for buck + misc power)
- Footprint for photodiodes are not ideal
- Encoder is not lined up with quadrature tracks (quadrature phase is not 90 degrees)

Otherwise, works fine!
